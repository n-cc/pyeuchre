# pyeuchre

Euchre implementation in Python.

The goal of this project is to provide:

- A library that implements the game of Euchre.
- Pluggable bots of varying strengths.
- A frontend to play games of Euchre via pyeuchre with human players or with bots.

## State

This project is still very much a WIP, and while parts of the backend are written, the cli is not. General TODO:

- Accomplish goals 1 & 3
- Write tests
